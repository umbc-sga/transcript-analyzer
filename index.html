            <h4>How to Use This App</h4>
            <p>
                This app was created to allow people to search and sort data from their transcripts to check graduation requirements, as well as to view trends in the data.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you click on the table headers, it allows you to sort the table by the data in that column. To search for specific data, use the filter dropdown and input elements. The search value supports OR statements by using the pipe character ("|"). See the example queries below on how to use it.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you apply a filter, it shows a subset of your data. If you have applied a filter, the next filter will be applied on that subset that is showing in the table, thus refining your data even more. This is called "filter stacking". This is why the search value supports OR statements, but not AND statements, because you can just stack filters. Pressing the Reset Filter button will go back to showing all of your transcript data.
            </p>
